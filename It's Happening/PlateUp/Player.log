Ignoring invalid [UpdateAfter] attribute on Kitchen.CompletingResearchStartsFire targeting Kitchen.UpdateTakesDuration.
This attribute can only order systems that are members of the same ComponentSystemGroup instance.
Make sure that both systems are in the same system group with [UpdateInGroup(typeof(Unity.Entities.SimulationSystemGroup)],
or by manually adding both systems to the same group's update list.
Ignoring invalid [UpdateAfter(Kitchen.TableUpdatesGroup)] attribute on Kitchen.CreateSurroundingAppliances because OrderFirst/OrderLast has higher precedence.
